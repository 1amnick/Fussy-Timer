Fussy Timer
======

A Countdown timer at the request of a twitch streamer.

Currently writes the time left to a file that is updated every second to be read from an OBS plugin.

The Chatbot has been merged into the main branch as I think development has reached a point where I deemed pointless.

Features:

-   Custom legnth in minutes and seconds 
  
-   Start and stop abilities
  
-   Text replacement for 0:00
  
-   Count up when input is 0:00
  
-   save and load settings
  
-   Automatically Load Settings on startup  

Chat Functionality:

This bot is designed to work with twitch and ankhbot.

-   !changejoin allows users to change join message to their preferred message.
-   !togglejoin allows all users to turn off or on their greeting.
-   !timeout a funny command I put in on a whim. to disable this from actually timing out someone remove mod powers from bot.
-   !aboutbot shows info about the version.
  
TODO:

-   ~~Connect this git to discord for updates.~~

-   Add in a chroma keyable text for OBS or other streaming software

-   if you see a guy named mikto1000 on the internet go bug him
